This is a small project for my COOA course at school. My team and I have conducted a general study on the ARM Cortex M3 microprocessor architecture. Subsequently, we used Assembly language to program on a microcontroller  this architecture, the STM32F103C8. The ARM Cortex M architecture is optimized and cost-effective. You should learn about it. <3
